# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/osc-websocket.git

Set up your machine:

    npm install

We recommand using ```nodemon``` instead of just ```node``` for developping. ```npm install -g nodemon```  

Make your change and commit it !

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
